    	<p>Hello, and thanks for your interest in this study on visual question generation from researchers at the University of Pittsburgh.  The task is as follows: we will show you several images.  For each image, you will have space to fill in two questions.  
		{% include 'rules.html' %}
		<p>For example, consider this image:</p>
		<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
			<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='aliens.jpg')}}" class="w-100 h-100 .img-fluid" style="object-fit: scale-down;">
		</div>
    	<p>Examples of bad questions would be "How many aliens are in this picture?" and "What color is the middle alien?" because those questions can be answered just by looking at the picture.  Examples of good questions would be, "Which of these aliens comes in peace?" and "Do aliens eat the same food as humans?"</p>
    	<p>This task should take you approximately 7-10 minutes.</p>
    	<p>After looking at images, we will ask for some final questions.  You <strong>cannot be excluded on the basis of any demographic information</strong>.  We will also ask if you recall ever having completed this survey before, and you <strong>cannot be excluded regardless of your answer</strong>  However, <strong>you will be excluded if:</strong></p>
   		<p><ul>
   			<li>You are vision impaired to the extent that you cannot see the images.</li>
   			<li>You do not answer any attention check questions correctly</li>
   		</ul></p>
   		<p>There are no foreseeable risks associated with this project, nor are there any direct benefits to you. Each participant will be compensated with $2.50 for completing the task.  Within Prolific, your data is identifiable only by your worker ID number; we will convert this to an anonymous identifier once we extract your data from Prolific.  Your responses will not be identifiable in any way.</p>
